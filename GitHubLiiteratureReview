An important source for understanding possible problems in analyzing GitHub, although some of its cautions may not apply as much to a more focused study of how the DH community uses GitHub, one that avoids big claims . This paper explores whether GitHub serves as a trustworthy source of data for studies of software engineering practices. It offers a helpful summary of prior work on version control tools such as SourceForge and GitHub. This work builds upon an earlier survey that found that many people use GitHub for storage and web hosting rather than software. It combines  "manual inspection of 434 GitHub repositories" and "quantitative analysis" of metadata from GitTorrent (2014).  It outlines 9 perils in using GitHub data, including: "A large portion of repositories are not for software development" and "Most projects are inactive."

Tools for GitHub analysis:  GHTorrent, GitHub archive, GitMiner.
