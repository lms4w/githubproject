# githubproject
Research project examining Github as a platform for humanities teaching &amp; research. As I kickoff this project, I intend to:
* inventory digital humanities projects using GitHub
* develop a typology of DH uses of GitHub (such as for software, syllabi and book projects)
* interview users from this community (these notes will probably not be shared via GitHub for reasons of confidentiality)
* summarize publications on GitHub
* go meta: use GitHub as a platform for thinking about GitHub
